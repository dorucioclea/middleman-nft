## Motivations of this project

I have recently seen numerous scams in the NFT space with people trying to bid with MEX for "bluechip" projects or acting as a middleman and rekting newcomers that just wanted to flip their NFTs. We are also seeing the emergence of several cashgrab projects on the Elrond Network with insane royalties (mainly 10%).

Those basics assumptions result in a community that is struggling to make benefits because of enormous royalties from projects and scammers that are seeking for newcomers to rekt.

That's why I am aiming at delivering a secure smart contract based p2p service in order to make trades between two accounts secure, easy and without enormous fees (only 2%). By doing so, I offer a secure way to trade NFT for EGLD between two accounts and I allow huge deals to happen without being charged for insane fees.

In the same time, I am sharing the code as long as I see near nobody with open source projects on Elrond. I will make sure to be 100% transparent in my future projects in order to help new devs contribute to the network.
